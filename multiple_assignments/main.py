#multiple assignment = allows us to assign multiple variables  at the same time in one line of code

# assigning each variable separately 
name = "Bro"
age = 22
is_attractive = True

print(name)
print(age)
print(is_attractive)

# same assignment as above but this will; be done in one line

name2, age2, is_attractive2 = "jorge", 35, True

print(name2)
print(age2)
print(is_attractive2)

# Another way to assign multiple variables, in this instance we are assigning the same value to 4 different var
Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30

print(Spongebob)
print(Sandy)
print(Patrick)
print(Squidward)
